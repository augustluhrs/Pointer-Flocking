## TODO

- [ ] multiplayer on glitch server
- [ ] game where boids change color to match their neighbors (click to change color)
- [ ] might need to draw pointers since tint is so expensive
- [X] green cloud background?
- [ ] how to get same canvas size for cross-platform? could just display relative position and store/send normalized values
- [ ] fancy font for slider labels?
- [ ] better slider layout
- [X] follow head in webcam with posenet
- [ ] add rotation to pointers? makes them less "pointer-y" tho...
